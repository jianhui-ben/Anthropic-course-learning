    "reasoning": "The solution meets all mandatory criteria: it provides exactly 5 titles in comma-separated JSON format with the 'out' key. All titles are legitimate TV series with procedural drama formats. The thematic alignment is excellent - Criminal Intent, Organized Crime, The Wire, Mindhunter, and Homicide are all crime/legal dramas with investigative elements similar to SVU. However, there is a factual error with 'SVU: Organized Crime' which should be 'Law & Order: Organized Crime' - this is a material mistake that affects accuracy despite meeting the structural requirements. The other titles are correctly named and highly relevant."

    "reasoning": "The solution correctly identifies 5 high-quality independent films that thematically align with Moonlight's exploration of identity, intimate character development, and coming-of-age narratives. Boyhood, Manchester by the Sea, Moonrise Kingdom, The Florida Project, and Waves are all festival-acclaimed, art-house films rather than mainstream blockbusters. The JSON structure includes the required 'out' field with all 5 titles. However, there is a minor formatting inconsistency: the task example shows titles as separate quoted strings (\"Top Gun\", \"The Dark Knight\", \"The Godfather\"), while this solution presents them as a single comma-separated string. This is a secondary formatting issue that doesn't affect the core content quality or JSON validity, but represents a deviation from the stated format specification."

While the solution could have diversified non-English selections beyond Korean cinema, this is a minor consideration as the criterion only requires 'non-English language titles' without specifying diversity of origin.
